* Each of these pre-bound events also have an event-specific payload associated with it that the triggering system will provide. However, this will also be used during testing and visible during development in the "Payload" tab.

* Other systems might invoke functions based on events, not only function, e.g. LiveEngage services will invoke functions that have the Event: "Chat Post Survey E-Mail Transcript".
